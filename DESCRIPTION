Version: 0.1.0
Author: Benjamin Christoffersen
Maintainer: Benjamin Christoffersen <boennecd@gmail.com>
Description: Contains functions that lets you fit dynamic hazard models with binary 
  outcomes using state space models. The methods are originally described in  
  Fahrmeir (1992) <http://bit.ly/2hE6Vwq> and Fahrmeir (1994) 
  <http://bit.ly/2i54DHO>. The functions also provide an extension hereof where the
