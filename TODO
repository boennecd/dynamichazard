Test that residuals works for second order random walk
Implement state space errors for EKF and exponential model. Requires computation of lag one correlation"
How to compute lag one covariance matrix with UKF
Fix bug with particle filter and exponential model
Replace `save_to_test` and `read_to_test` with `testthat::expect_known_output`
Make on family cpp function and use throughout all estimation methods and in R
Remove all the exp_... from the EKF and use Poisson model with offsets instead
Use `src/family.h` in `src/ddhazard/GMA_solver.cpp`
Use `src/family.h` in `src/ddhazard/SMA_solver.cpp`
Use `src/family.h` in `src/PF/densities.cpp`
Use `src/family.h` when computing residuals
Use `src/family.h` when approx hat values
Use `src/family.h` in predict
Update vignettes to reflect use the new setup with `src/family.h`
