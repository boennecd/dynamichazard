test that residuals works for second order random walk
replace `save_to_test` and `read_to_test` with `testthat::expect_known_output`
make functions for `ddhazard` and `PF_EM` where you only take one iteration
and can provide your own structural matrices
make ESS function
make mean and quantile function for pf_clouds
make sure plot works with forward filter only
also scale Q as in ddhazard in the particle filter
