Test that residuals works for second order random walk
Replace `save_to_test` and `read_to_test` with `testthat::expect_known_output`
Make functions for `ddhazard` and `PF_EM` where you only take one iteration
and can provide your own structural matrices
Why is GMA slower than in commint 40d2cd438c79e1d77b28421d26b8289f40d3909c in speedtests?
Make `parallelglm` use `src/family`
Make wrapper to PF function for main setup steps to ease custom user setup + test. Make similar changes to ddhazard. Document these in NEWS.
Make PF_data argument + test
Make ESS function + test
Make mean and quantile function for pf_clouds + test
Make sure plot works with forward filter only + test
Make the forward particle filters avialable on its own for likelihood evaluation + test
Make example of particle filtering w/ e.g., LME4
