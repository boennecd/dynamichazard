Test that residuals works for second order random walk
Implement state space errors for EKF and exponential model. Requires
computation of lag one correlation"
How to compute lag one covariance matrix with UKF
Fix bug with particle filter and exponential model
Replace `save_to_test` and `read_to_test` with `testthat::expect_known_output`
Use `src/family.h` in `src/PF/densities.cpp`
Use `src/family.h` when computing residuals
Use `src/family.h` when approx hat values
Use `src/family.h` in predict
Update vignettes to reflect use the new setup with `src/family.h`
Make functions for `ddhazard` and `PF_EM` where you only take one iteration
and can provide your own structural matrices
Refactor code to get rid of `ddhazard_data_EKF` and simplify code in
`/srcddhazard_fit.cpp`
