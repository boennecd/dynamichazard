## opts_chunk$set() can change the default global options in a document (e.g. put this in a code chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path='figures/',

               fig.width=6, fig.height=4,
               out.width="0.7\\textwidth",
               size='tiny',                ## See R highligt package for possible values (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/highlight/highlight.pdf)
               small.mar = TRUE,
               my.options = TRUE,

## Introduction
This note will compare the dynamic discrete model fitted with the Extended Kalman (EKF) filter to with Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for the logistic model. We will use a simulated data set in order to compare the two 


TODO: Write about main findings

## Simulation
First, we will need to simulate the data. We first simulate $\vec{ \beta }_t = \vec{\beta}_{t-1} + \vec{\eta}_t$ where $\vec{\eta}_t \sim N(\vec{0}, I)$. We then model the death of invidual $i$ in period $t$ by $\pi_i = \exp (\vec{\beta}^T \vec{x}_it) / (1 + \exp (\vec{\beta}^T \vec{x}_it))$. We update the covariate vector for the $i$'th invidual with gabs of $1 + z$ where $z \sim \text{Pois} (1)$. We let $x_{itk} ~ \text{Unif}(a,b)$ for given values $a$ and $b$

There is a function to do in the `R` folder called `test_sim_func_logit`: 
```{r}
# We are currenlty in the vignettes folder
getwd()
source("../R./test_utils.R")
test_sim_func_logit
```

The `get_zyx_draw` function are conveniente function that runs faster than the equivelent sampling function like `rnorm` when we simulate few outcomes:
```{r}
# We are currenlty in the vignettes folder
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  get_unif_draw(1),
  runif(1),
  times = 1e6
)

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  get_unif_draw(10),
  runif(10),
  times = 1e5
)
```

## Comparing
We simulate as follows:

```{r}
set.seed(20160904) # a good day
sims <- test_sim_func_logit(n_series = (n_series <- 2e3), 
                            n_vars = (n_vars <- 4), 
                            t_0 = (t_0 <- 0), 
                            t_max = (t_max <- 10),
                            x_range = (x_range <- .1), 
                            x_mean = (x_mean <- -.6), 
                            re_draw = T)
sims$res <- as.data.frame(sims$res)
```

We have a total of `r n_series` series, with `r n_vars` co-variates. The simulated co-variates are:
```{r}
sims$betas
```

Further we start at time `r t_0` and end at time `r t_max` giving us `r t_max - t_0` intervals. Lastly, the covariates are simulated to uniformly distributed within [`r x_mean + c(-1, 1) * x_range / 2`]. The first 10 rows of the final data frame look like: 
```{r}
head(sims$res, 10)
```

Next, we get the design matrix and risk set object for `ddhazard_fit_cpp_prelim` by using the the following functions from `benssurvutils`:
```{r}
design_mat <- benssurvutils::get_design_matrix(survival::Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ x1 + x2 + x3, sims$res)
rist_sets <- benssurvutils::get_risk_sets(design_mat$Y, by = 1, max_T = 10, id = sims$res$id)

design_mat$Y[, 2] <- rist_sets$stop_new
design_mat$Y[, 3] <- rist_sets$new_events_flags
```

The last two lines update the failure flags and stop times. It is need for the logic `ddhazard_fit_cpp_prelim` to check in which period a row counts as a death or as a control. E.g. say that we have row from time [3, 7.5] with a failure at the end. It is a control period [3, 4), [4, 5), [5, 6) and [6, 7) and a case in period [7, 8)

The final number of failures series that end with a death with `r t_max` are:
```{r}
sum(design_mat$Y[, 3] & design_mat$Y[, 2] <= t_max)
```

### Fitting EKF
We start by fitting the EKF. We do it with the following call:

```{r}
arg_list <- list(X = design_mat$X, tstart = design_mat$Y[, 1],  tstop = design_mat$Y[, 2], events = design_mat$Y[, 3],
                 a_0 = (a_0 <- rep(0, ncol(design_mat$X))),
                 Q_0 = (Q_0 <- diag(1, ncol(design_mat$X))),
                 Q = (Q <- diag(1, ncol(design_mat$X))),
                 F_ = diag(1, ncol(design_mat$X)),
                 risk_obj = rist_sets,
                 eps = 10^-2, n_max = 10^4,
                 order_ = 1,
                 est_Q_0 = F,
                 verbose = T)

system.time(fit_EKF <- do.call(ddhazard_fit_cpp_prelim, arg_list))
```

We start $\vec{\beta}_0$ as [`r a_0`], the initial co-variance, $Q_0$ as a digonal matrix with elements [`r Q_0`] and the co-variance matrix in state space queation, $Q$ as a diagonal matrix with elements [`r Q_0`]. Further, keep $Q_0$ fixed in each iteration by setting $est_Q_0 = F$

Next, we fit the same model with the UKF:
```{r}
arg_list$method = "UKF"

system.time(fit_UKF <- do.call(ddhazard_fit_cpp_prelim, arg_list))
```
