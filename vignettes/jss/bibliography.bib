title = {New Extension of the Kalman Filter to Nonlinear Systems},
journal = {Proc. SPIE},
volume = {3068},
number = {},
pages = {182-193},
abstract = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

abstract = "The performance of the modified unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for nonlinear stochastic discrete-time system with linear measurement equation is investigated. It is proved that under certain conditions, the estimation error of the \{UKF\} remains bounded. Furthermore, it is shown that the design of noise covariance matrix plays an important role in improving the stability of the algorithm. Error behavior of the \{UKF\} is then derived in terms of mean square error (MSE), and the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) is introduced as a performance measure. The modified \{UKF\} is found to approach the \{CRLB\} if the difference between the real noise covariance matrix and the selected one is small enough. These results are verified by using Monte Carlo simulations on two example systems. "

 abstract = {In this paper, we develop a posterior mode estimation method for nonlinear and non-Gaussian state space models. By exploiting special structures of the state space models, we derive a modified quadratic hill-climbing procedure which can be implemented efficiently in O(n) operations. The method can be used for estimating the state variable, performing Bayesian inference and carrying out Monte Carlo likelihood inference. Numerical illustrations using simulated and real data demonstrate that our procedure is much more efficient than a common gradient method. It is also evident that our method works very well in a new stochastic volatility model which contains a nonlinear state equation.},

The treatment in both cases is based on simulation using importance sampling and antithetic variables; Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are not employed. Non-Gaussian disturbances for the state equation as well as for the observation equation are considered. Methods for estimating conditional and posterior means of functions of the state vector given the observations, and the mean-square errors of their estimates, are developed. These methods are extended to cover the estimation of conditional and posterior densities and distribution functions. Choice of importance sampling densities and antithetic variables is discussed. The techniques work well in practice and are computationally efficient. Their use is illustrated by applying them to a univariate discrete time series, a series with outliers and a volatility series.},

The R package pomp provides a very flexible framework for Monte Carlo statistical investigations using nonlinear, non-Gaussian POMP models. A range of modern statistical methods for POMP models have been implemented in this framework including sequential Monte Carlo, iterated filtering, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, approximate Bayesian computation, maximum synthetic likelihood estimation, nonlinear forecasting, and trajectory matching. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of these methodologies using some simple toy problems. We also illustrate the specification of more complex POMP models, using a nonlinear epidemiological model with a discrete population, seasonality, and extra-demographic stochasticity. We discuss the specification of user-defined models and the development of additional methods within the programming environment provided by pomp.},

abstract = "A new method of data augmentation for binary and multinomial logit models is described. First, the latent utilities are introduced as auxiliary latent variables, leading to a latent model which is linear in the unknown parameters, but involves errors from the type I extreme value distribution. Second, for each error term the density of this distribution is approximated by a mixture of normal distributions, and the component indicators in these mixtures are introduced as further latent variables. This leads to Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation based on a convenient auxiliary mixture sampler that draws from standard distributions like normal or exponential distributions and, in contrast to more common Metropolis–Hastings approaches, does not require any tuning. It is shown how the auxiliary mixture sampler is implemented for binary or multinomial logit models, and it is demonstrated how to extend the sampler to mixed effect models and time-varying parameter models for binary and categorical data. Finally, an application to Austrian labor market data is discussed. "

   abstract = {We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with convex penalties. The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multi- nomial regression problems while the penalties include ℓ1 (the lasso), ℓ2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},

   abstract = {Survival estimates are an essential compliment to multivariable regression models for time-to-event data, both for prediction and illustration of covariate effects. They are easily obtained under the Cox proportional-hazards model. In populations defined by an initial, acute event, like myocardial infarction, or in studies with long-term followup, the proportional-hazards assumption of constant hazard ratios is frequently violated. One alternative is to fit an interaction between covariates and a prespecified function of time, implemented as a time-dependent covariate. This effectively creates a time-varying coefficient that is easily estimated in software such as SAS and R. However, the usual programming statements for survival estimation are not directly applicable. Unique data manipulation and syntax is required, but is not well documented for either software. This paper offers a tutorial in survival estimation for the time-varying coefficient model, implemented in SAS and R. We provide a macro coxtvc to facilitate estimation in SAS where the current functionality is more limited. The macro is validated in simulated data and illustrated in an application. },
